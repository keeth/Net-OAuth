0.25   Sun, 21 Mar 2010 03:50:40 UTC
       - Gah, $VERSION lameness

       - Fix test breakage in 0.23

0.23   Thu, 18 Mar 2010 17:23:36 UTC
       - Removed UNIVERSAL::require dependency
       - Net::OAuth->request constructor now dies if module fails to load (thanks Mike Schleif)
       - Fixed RT#55635 Incorrect dependencies (thanks Jens Rehsack)
       - Replaced die() with croak()

0.22   Thu, 11 Mar 2010 00:21:26 UTC
       - Renamed xAuthAccessTokenRequest to XauthAccessTokenRequest for CamelCaseConsistency
       - Added a couple tests for XauthAccessTokenRequest

       - Added xAuth support with xAuthAccessTokenRequest (thanks Masayoshi Sekimura and Simon Wistow)
       - Added performance patch to decrease stat() system calls when requiring modules (thanks Brad Whitaker)

0.20   Fri, 13 Nov 2009 18:56:55 UTC
       - Fixed RT#48867 - error in synopsis - thanks Adam Taylor!
       - Removed UTF8 double-encoding warning.  Now Net::OAuth::Message::encode() uses Encode::is_utf8() to determine if
         the input is already UTF-8 encoded.  If so, it runs decode_utf8() on it before sending it to uri_escape_utf8().
         Thanks Hector Garcia Alvarez!
       - Potentially fixed an issue found by Marc Mims, where HMAC_SHA1 was failing to load, breaking some CPAN tests.
         Build.PL now explicitly requires Digest::SHA1 and Encode.  Hopefully that fixes it.

0.19   Fri, 26 Jun 2009 17:30:06 UTC
       [Bug Fixes]
       - Fixed RT#47369 - Don't automatically set oauth_version parameter when message is created via from_hash (or

       [Bug Fixes]
       - Fixed RT#47293 - Message->from_hash was validating using the incorrect class, causing a 'Parameter X not valid
         for a message of type Y' message on V1.0a messages.  Thanks Jeff Dairiki!
